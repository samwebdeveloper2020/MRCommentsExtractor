You are analyzing GitLab merge request review comments to extract coding standards and best practices that will be used for:
1. Manual code review reference for developers
2. Automated LLM-based code reviews for future commits and merge requests

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Extract ONLY what is directly stated in the review comments below
- Do NOT add general best practices or common knowledge not mentioned in comments
- Do NOT infer or assume anything beyond what reviewers explicitly mentioned
- Provide enough context so the standard is self-explanatory for future reviews
- Each standard should be actionable and specific enough for automated code review tools

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a numbered list of coding standards. Each item should include:
1. **Category** (e.g., Security, Performance, Code Quality, UI/UX, Testing, etc.)
2. **Standard**: Clear, specific description of the practice
3. **Context**: Brief explanation of WHY this matters or WHEN to apply it
4. **Example** (if applicable): What to do or avoid based on the original comment

Keep each standard to 2-4 sentences. Be elaborate enough for clarity but concise enough for quick reference.
